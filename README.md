# DROPStomo
DROPStomo is a python package for performing state and process tomography in the context of finite-dimensional Wigner representation on near-term quantum devices. This is a phase-space tomography approach to recover the finite-dimensional Wigner representations, with a particular focus on the [DROPS](https://spindrops.org/) (Discrete Representation of OPeratorS) representation. The package is based on paper: 

This package is based on Qiskit framework and can be easily adaptable for other frameworks. The package can be plugged in directly into quantum simulators or quantum devices.  

## Installation
```bash
pip install DROPStomo
```

## How to use?
Currently, Wigner state tomography is available for single and two qubit system, whereas Wigner process tomography is available for single qubit system. 
To use single qubit Wigner tomography please see an example file:
